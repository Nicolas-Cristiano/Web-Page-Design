<h1>First Home Savings Account</h1>
	<p>The <b>First Home Savings Account</b> (normally referred to as the FHSA) is a Tax-Free Savings account initiated in April 2023. 
	Its main purpose is to help potential home-buyers save money to buy their first house.</p>
	<!--<div id="banner" style="overflow: hidden; display: flex; justify-content:space-around;">-->

	</div>
	
	<br><br>
	
	<p>In order to become eligible for the FHSA, you must meet the following conditions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Residence in Canada</li>
		<li>At least 18 year of age</li>
		<li>Be a first-time home buyer</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>NOTE:</b> This means that you or a spouse/common-law partner did not own a qualifying home that served as your main residence.</p><br>
	
	<p>The FHSA combines the benefits of a <b>Tax-Free Savings Account</b> (or TFSA) and <b>Registered Retirement Savings Plan</b> (or RRSP). The earnings the contributions 
	make inside the FHSA and withdrawals from it are tax-free, similar to a TFSA. Likewise, contributions to the FHSA are tax-deductible, similar to an RRSP.</p>
	
	<p>As with RRSP's and TFSA's, a FHSA can hold several different investments such as Mutual Funds, Stocks, Bonds and 
	Guranteed Investment Certificates (GIC's).</p>
	
	<p>You are able to contribute $8000/year into the FHSA, with total of $40,000 over its lifetime. 
	If you exceeed the yearly contribution limit, you are taxed 1% on the overcontribution amount each month that the account is over limit. For example, if you open a 
	FHSA in April of 2024 and contribute $10,000, you are taxed 1% on that additional $2000 each month from April to December.</p>
	
	<p>You are able carry over a maximum of $8000 from year to year. For example, if you open a FHSA in 2023 and only invest
    $2000 that year, you are able to carry over the extra $6000 into the following year(s) and can contribute up to $14000 the following year. If you exceed
	the lifetime contribution limit, you get taxed 1% on the overcontribution amount each month that the account is over limit.</p><br>
	
	<b>Example</b><br>
	<p>Lisa contributes $1000 and $2000 during Year 1 and Year 2 respectively. What is the maximum amount she can contribute during Year 3?</p>
	<p>First, we can find the sum of the carry over amounts from Years 1 and 2 and determine if we can carry over the full amount to add to Year 3's contribution:</p>
	<center>
		<font color="red">Year3CarryOver</font> = <font color="green">Year1CarryOver</font> + <font color="blue">Year2CarryOver</font><br>
		<font color="red">Year3CarryOver</font> = <font color="green">($8000-$1000)</font> + <font color="blue">($8000-$2000)</font><br>
		<font color="red">Year3CarryOver</font> = <font color="green">$7000</font> + <font color="blue">$6000</font><br>
		<font color="red">Year3CarryOver</font> = $13000
	</center><br>
	<p>We can then compare the Carry Over amount we determined in the previous step to the Maximum Carry Over amount to determine which Carry Over amount we can use:</p>
	<center>
		$13000 > $8000<br>
		<font color="red">Year3CarryOver = $8000</font>
	</center><br>
	<p>We have determined that we cannot add the full carry over amount to Year 3's contribution as it is greater than $8000, the carry over limit. Instead, we can add
		that $8000 to another $8000, the regular contribution amount:</p>  
	<center>
		<font color="magenta">TotalContribution</font> = <font color="red">Year3CarryOver</font> + <font color="olive">Year3Contribution</font><br>
		<font color="magenta">TotalContribution</font> = <font color="red">$8000</font> + <font color="olive">$8000</font><br>
		<font color="magenta">TotalContribution = $16000</font>
	</center><br>
	<p>Therefore, we can determine that Lisa can contribute a maximum of $16,000 during Year 3.</p>
	<hr>
	
	<h2>Withdrawals</h2>
	<p>The amount that you withdraw from your FHSA to make a qualified house purchase will be non-taxable. You must meet the following conditions if you want to make 
	   a withdrawal:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Be a first-time home buyer. Exceptions can be made to allow individuals to make their withdrawal within 30 days of moving into their home</li>
		<li>Have a written agreement to buy or build a qualifying home before October 1st of the year following the withdrawal, and intend to occupy the home 
		as the main place of residence within one year of buying or building it</li>
		<li>Home is a housing unit located in Canada</li>
	</ul><br>
	<p>Any funds remaining after making a qualifying withdrawal can then be transferred to an RRSP or Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF), penalty-free and tax-deferred. This can be done as long as you transfer the funds by December 31st of the following year, since the FHSA ceases to remain as such by that point. Transfers don't reduce or limit avaialble RRSP room. </p>
	<p>If you take out FHSA savings as a non-qualifying withdrawal, you must include the amount in income for the year of the withdrawal and the tax to be withheld.</p>
	<p>Finally, withdrawals and transfers don't replenish FHSA contribution limits. This means, for example. that if you contributed the maximum amount of funds into the FHSA for
	that year and suddenly decide to withdraw $4000, you cannot contribute an additional $4000.</p>
	<p>If you decide not to withdraw any money from the FHSA to purchase a house, it will cease to exist either:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>By the end of the 15th year you opened it</li>
		<li>By the end of the year you turn 71</li>
	</ul><br>
	<p>Any unused funds can either get transferred into either an RRSP or RRIF or withdrawn with tax.</p>
	<p>As stated above, you can transfer funds into either an RRSP or RRIF without affecting the contribution limit of either account. This can be done in case you don't end up buying a qualifying home.</p>
	<p>In addition, you can transfer funds from an RRSP to a FHSA tax-free, up to the $40,000 lifetime and $8000 annual contribution limits. It should be noted that these transfers would not restore RRSP contribution room or generate a tax deduction. The main advantage to transferring funds from an RRSP to a FHSA is that the subsequent qualifying withdrawal from the FHSA would be tax-free, essentially making it a tax-free RRSP withdrawal.</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>Earnings and Totals</h2>
	<p>We can use Compund Interest in order to determine how the contributions in your FHSA can grow tax-free.</p>
	<p>This is the equation we use to determine Compound Interest:</p>
	<center>
		\(\textcolor{blue}{A} = \textcolor{red}{P}(1+\textcolor{green}{i})^\textcolor{magenta}{t}\)
	</center><br>
	<ul>
	<li>\(\textcolor{red}{P}\) refers to the original contribution amount</li>
	<li>\(\textcolor{blue}{A}\) refers to the final amount</li>
	<li>\(\textcolor{green}{i}\) refers to the periodic interest rate or rate of return</li>
	<li>\(\textcolor{magenta}{t}\) refers to the time in years</li>
	</ul><br>
	
	<b>Example</b>
	<p>Calculate your total earnings if you contributed an initial amount of $8000 that earns 5% interest over 2 years.</p>
	<p>We can begin by plugging the respective values into the Compound Interest formula to determine the Final Amount:</p>
	<center>
		\(\textcolor{blue}{A} = \textcolor{red}{P}(1+\textcolor{green}{i})^\textcolor{magenta}{t}\)<br>
		\(\textcolor{blue}{A} = \textcolor{red}{$8000}(1+0.05)^\textcolor{magenta}{2}\)<br>
		\(\textcolor{blue}{A} = \textcolor{red}{$8000}(1.05)^\textcolor{magenta}{2}\)<br>
		\(\textcolor{blue}{A} = \textcolor{red}{$8000}(1.1025)\)<br>
		\(\textcolor{blue}{A = $8820}\)
	</center><br>
	<p>We can now subtract the original contribution ($8000) from the final amount ($8820) to determine what we made in earnings (E).</p>
	<center>
		\(E = \textcolor{blue}{A} - \textcolor{red}{P}\)<br>
		\(E = \textcolor{blue}{$8820} - \textcolor{red}{$8000}\)<br>
		\(E = $820\)
	</center><br>
	<p>We determined that we made $820 in earnings over a period of 2 years from contributing an initial amount of $8000.</p>
